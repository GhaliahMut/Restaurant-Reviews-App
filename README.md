## About the Project
The code provided here has alot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser, much less a mobile device. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline at all. The purpose of project to test my ability as a developer to update the code and resolve these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.
